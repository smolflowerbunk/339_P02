                <h1 class="about-title">About Us</h1>

                <p>Founded in the heart of Vancouver, Petit Amours is recognized for its artful geometric chocolate creations. While the cacao we use is farmed from outside of the country from partners that use ethical and sustainable farming practices, our ingredients are sourced year-round from local BC farms in an effort to support the community we were born in.</p>
                
                <h1 class="about-title">Our Mission</h1>

                <p>We'd like to add a special touch to make moments memorable. Whether it be a celebration, anniversary, or a simple gift to a loved one, we hope that our creations make your day all the more special. Memories are unique as is each person, so we strive to elevate experiences by invigorating the senses.</p>
                
                <h1 class="about-title">Values</h1>
                
                <p>Flavour, ethics, and innovation are important for each release, as artistry and the science of chocolate combine to develop flavours as diverse as our tasters. We source ingredients locally to support our community while reducing our carbon footprint through minimal transportation distance, and only partner with cacao farms that use ethical and sustainable farming practices. This means that the farms we partner with use renewable energy sources, have strict water management, and reduce their use of environmental pollutants when farming their crops.</p>
